# Computational Design and Optimization of Non-Circular Gears (Eurographics 2020)

TODO:
# Installation
# How to use the code (what functions do we have):
- create gear from the input shape (what is the entry of the code)
- what intermediate results do we have
# How the code is organized
# The MIT license?

# The code is still being polished.


# How to run some results

1. update your repo to the latest master version

2. open folders_to_optimize.txt, delete all contents, and type in the folder pairs you want to optimize, each pair per line
(please directly use copy-and-paste function to copy from below to avoid issues related to format)

3. cross out the pairs assigned to you in this document

4. some folder may consist too much more silhouettes than others, don't bite off more than you can chew.
